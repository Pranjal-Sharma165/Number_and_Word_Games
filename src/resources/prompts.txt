"Can you implement a timer in JavaFX to add a time-based challenge for the game?"
"Can you implement a system to generate random sequences of numbers and words for each level of the game?"
"How can I ensure the difficulty of the game increases with each level?"
"Can you implement a mechanism to show a 'Congratulations' message after completing all 10 levels?"
"Can you suggest a design to highlight the sequence text for better visibility?"
"How can I style the buttons to make them visually distinct between active and disabled states?"
"Can you create a dialog box that appears when the game ends, showing the final score and asking if the user
wants to play again?"
"Can you implement a countdown timer in JavaFX for each level, with visual feedback using a progress bar?"
"Whatâ€™s the best way to handle timeout events when the player fails to enter the sequence in time?"
"Can you ensure the start button is disabled after the game begins and only re-enabled when the game is reset?"
"How can I apply CSS styles to make the UI visually appealing, like adding custom fonts and colors?"
"How can I highlight the sequence on the screen for a brief period before hiding it?"

When working with the AI to implement the sequence highlighting feature for the Escape Room game, the experience
was both rewarding and occasionally frustrating. The best part was the AI's ability to quickly suggest practical
solutions, such as using JavaFX threads and `Platform.runLater` to display the sequence for a specific duration,
combined with CSS for visual emphasis. It provided a clear pathway to handle the challenge of showing and hiding
the sequence dynamically. However, the worst part was ensuring the AI fully understood the context of the game's
flow and the dependencies between components like `GameEngine` and `GameUI`. There were moments of miscommunication
where suggestions didn't align with the game's structure, requiring multiple clarifications. Despite this, the
overall collaboration was productive, and the AI's guidance significantly streamlined the development process.
